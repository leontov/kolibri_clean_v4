# Kolibri Phase 2 Execution Blueprint (Capabilities 41–120)

This document replaces the prior high-level roadmap with an execution-ready blueprint that decomposes capabilities 41–120
into concrete workstreams, service changes, deliverables, and validation gates. It assumes Phase 1 foundations (core runtime,
policy service, baseline planner, evaluation harness) are in production. Workstreams are sequenced into four overlapping waves
with explicit dependencies, but each table can feed directly into a backlog tool.

## Delivery Governance

- **Wave Cadence:**
  - **Wave A (Weeks 1–6):** Launch SkillStore v1.0, predictive planner core, initial active-learning loop.
  - **Wave B (Weeks 5–11):** Security, explainability, and simulation layers hardened in parallel.
  - **Wave C (Weeks 9–16):** Multiplatform UX, offline/edge readiness, advanced observability.
  - **Wave D (Weeks 14–22):** Device ecosystem, developer portal, monetization scale, CI/CD.
- **Program RACI:** Marketplace PMO owns items 41–48; Planner Guild owns 49–56; Data Learning Guild owns 57–64; Simulation SRE
  owns 65–72; Experience Tribe owns 73–80; Trust & Governance owns 81–88; Platform Ops owns 89–96; Edge Pod owns 97–104;
  Device Partnerships owns 105–112; Developer Relations owns 113–120.
- **Release Gates:** Each capability bundle requires (a) security sign-off, (b) observability instrumentation linked to the
  Kolibri action journal, and (c) stakeholder walkthrough recorded in Confluence.

## 1. SkillStore & Marketplace (41–48)

### Architecture & Components
- Extend **skill_catalog** service with ranking API (`GET /v1/skills?sort=`) sourcing vectors from quality scoring jobs,
  review aggregates, and policy compliance signals. Ranking weights stored in `marketplace.rank_profile` table.

  allowlists, and CVE signature scanning.
- Introduce **permission_broker** microservice issuing scoped OAuth tokens based on trust tiers, context (user, org, mission),
  and runtime policy evaluation; persists grants in `permissions.dynamic_grants`.
- Harden **skill_sandbox_runner** with Firecracker microVM profiles and resource quota controller; attach virtualized IO bus
  (`vsock`) for deterministic replay.
- Publish **kolibri-skill-sdk** (Node + Python templates) featuring CLI generator (`kolibri-skill init`) and Jest/PyTest harnesses.
- Stand up **partner_program_portal** (Next.js) for grant workflow, KPI dashboards, and compliance checklists.
- Embed **skill_chain_composer** into planner UI and backend aggregator to orchestrate composite missions via DAG manifests.
